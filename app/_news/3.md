Thomas made his Alliance Theatre debut as Will in *Shakespeare in Love*, directed by Richard Garner.

“A dizzying achievement and a fortuitous moment for the Alliance […] Azar and Lind are lovely as Will and Viola.” — [Atlanta Journal-Constitution](http://www.myajc.com/entertainment/arts--theater/review-garner-delivers-delightful-shakespeare-love-for-alliance/7mE2EIDfjeatk5z8EyWCwN/)

“Will, extremely well played by Thomas Azar in his Alliance debut, is a living, loving, likable young man” —
[Atlanta INtown Paper](http://atlantaintownpaper.com/2017/09/theatre-review-shakespeare-love-alliance/)

“Both Thomas Azar as Will and Bethany Anne Lind as Viola are delightful, and the natural chemistry between the two creates an appealing sexiness that perfumes every scene.” — [Broadway World Atlanta](https://www.broadwayworld.com/atlanta/article/BWW-Review-SHAKESPEARE-IN-LOVE-at-Alliance-Theatre-20170915)
