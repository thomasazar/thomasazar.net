title: Did We Forget Anything?
---

Tomorrow, we leave for rehearsals for _Cry It Out_ at Lean Ensemble Theater. And when I say "we", I mean me, Maegan, Tristan, and Benjamin. For those keeping track at home, that's the parents, a three-year-old, and a dog. It's a grand experiment, the first time we've packed up the entire family to go work on a show away from home that both Maegan and I are in.

I don't think we have enough suitcases.

When it comes to packing, I tend to overpack. My dad taught me long ago to pack for every day I'll be gone, plus one. Just in case. Well, as much as I love wearing T-shirts, I don't think I have four weeks worth, mostly because I Marie Kondo'd my clothes last year. (I estimate I've managed to pare down to a slim two-and-a-half dozen, including undershirts and pajama shirts). So instead the number I'm shooting for is eight, as in one for every day of the week, plus one for laundry day.

It's the kiddo's stuff that I'm more worried about. Already the trunk of the car is nearly at capacity, and I haven't even put the clothes in. I'd pretend that we're bringing all of his toys, but a glance at my home office confirms that we're actually barely scratching the surface. Construction vehicles take up a lot of space.

It's my intention to keep a journal of sorts of the experience. That the show is about new parents feel extra appropriate for the attempt we are making. Juggling rehearsal schedules with babysitter schedules with nap schedules and meals and oh yeah what about the beach and maybe we can go putt-putt today if it doesn't rain. So, forgive me if I don't keep things regular, but I do want to try to get my thoughts down. Because maybe this can happen again in the future.
