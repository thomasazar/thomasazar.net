title: It Finds Me When I Need It
---

Like many actors, I appreciate having a personal soundtrack that I listen to before the show, usually when I making my way to the theatre. Sometimes the songs are meant to excite me, get my blood pumping, leave me ready to tear down walls. Other times, it helps reframe my mind more into the head space of my character. And there's the time where my preshow soundtrack was vocal warmups, because I was doing a musical and that scared the bejeezus out of me.

When I am paralyzed with doubt shortly before starting a rehearsal -- which always, *always* happens -- Maegan reminds me that I should compile my playlist. Sometimes, I'm able to do that pretty quickly. I can identify songs that speak to me in a way that feels right for the show. It helps me get over the paralysis and move on to doing the work I need to do before that first rehearsal (or else this will surely be the one where I'm found out to be a fraud).

Sometimes, though, that playlist won't materialize. I'll think about it (but I won't brood over it), but I'm just not able to put together a list of three to five songs that work. Such a simple task, and yet...

And then, at some point in the process, be it early on or (like for *Glass*) late in the game, I realize that I've been listening to the same songs between home and work. It happened last night, as I once again put on the Red Hot Chili Peppers. As I was singing along (incredibly well, mind you, totally in tune and on key), I listened to the words. "Holy crap", said I, "that sounds like Tom." To me, that is, it sounds like Tom. It doesn't have to make sense to anyone else, but it does to me, and it clicked at that moment. Here are some of the lyrics that jumped out:

> Standing in line to see the show tonight  
And there's a light on, heavy glow  
By the way I tried to say  
I'd be there waiting for  
Dani the girl is singing songs to me  
Beneath the marquee  
Overload

> -- "By the Way", Red Hot Chili Peppers

> Can't stop, addicted to the shindig  
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big  
Choose not a life of imitation  
Distant cousin to the reservation  
[...]  
The world I love, the tears I drop  
To be part of the wave, can't stop  
Ever wonder if it's all for you?  
The world I love, the trains I hop  
To be part of the wave, can't stop  
Come and tell me when it's time to  

> -- "Can't Stop", Red Hot Chili Peppers
