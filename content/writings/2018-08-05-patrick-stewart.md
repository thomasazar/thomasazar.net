title: Sir Patrick Stewart and the art of storytelling
---

Okay, if you didn't know this about me before, know it now: I am a giant nerd. I have been for most of my life -- proudly, I might add. Heck, I built this website myself, and I've had it running in various forms for over a decade now. But I digress.

One of my bits of nerd-dom is an affinity for *Star Trek: The Next Generation*, starring Patrick Stewart as Captain Jean-Luc Picard. I have very fond memories of watching it as a kid, and I've since watched it again as an adult. And sure, some of it is late 80's/early 90's cheesy, but **so much** of it is just fantastic. A lot of that is thanks to Patrick Stewart, a classically trained actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company.

The man knows how to tell a story. Just watch this announcement at a recent *Star Trek* convention in Las Vegas:

Did you see him wipe a tear away as the audience cheered? **That's the power of storytelling.** Not just the story of his audition, working on the show, turning down the initial offer, and finally returning to the character of Picard. But the power of telling so many stories over so many years that touched so many people. He knows the value of the art of storytelling. I'm very excited to see what he'll tell us in the near future about Captain Picard.
