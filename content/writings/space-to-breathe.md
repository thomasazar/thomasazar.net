The rain has been constant since the day we got here. The roads and driveways are flooding, which means puddle splashing and puppy jumping (seriously, it's adorable when Benjamin hops over standing water). We almost made to the beach once, but turned back just in time to not get rained on.

Here are some things I have in the three days since we've been in Hilton Head:

- Potty breaks must be scheduled, no matter what the response is to the question, "Do you need to potty?"
- After finishing a potty break, and after **washing all hands** involved in the potty break, look around the room: is the travel potty seat still on the toilet? If the answer is yes, then go get it, because otherwise it's staying in that gas station about 45 minutes away from your final destination.
- A perfectly timed dinner tastes so much better.
- Doing a video conference table read of your first scene is really just doing a table read to the camera, but hopefully it gives the others in the room something to work with.
- If rain is 30 minutes away, it's really 15 minutes away, so get out there and go for a walk with the family.
- And bring poop bags for the pup.
- A lot of fun can be had by just saying yes to the kiddo.
- Hearing "I love you" is never old (although to be fair, I already knew that. Just helps to be reminded of it, too.)
- Something is always forgotten at home, but almost everything can be replaced on the trip.
- There's a Duck Donuts opening somewhere in Hilton Head.
- Working for just a couple of hours today in the rehearsal hall with Maegan sitting next to me is about the most artistically refreshing thing I've experienced in a while. Just when I thought I've admired her for everything I could think of, she simultaneously becomes someone else entirely _and_ helps me unpack and uncover my character, because she both an actor and teacher (and a director, but that's not her job on this show). When I'm staring at her? That's just me 'mirin her.
- I need to allow myself space to breathe. Not in the sense that I need isolation, but rather in the Alexandran sense of taking a moment and breathing before reacting. Exhaustion from stress and travel can lead to a spiral of bad decisions, usually made in the blink of an eye without considering what comes next. Conscious inhibition is a muscle that needs training like any other, or else it will weaken and fade. I can be truer to my best self if I allow myself space to breathe in each moment, both onstage and off.
