title: My Teachers
---

As an artist, I owe almost everything to my teachers. Without them, I would be half the theatre artist that I am. Less than half, probably.<!--more-->

- Lonny Harrison: introduced me to theatre, cast me in my first show (*Grease*, I played Sonny)
- Liz Donaldson: guided me through the terror of having to sing in my first show
- Miles DeMott: ninth grade English, helped me to understand symbolism
- Clifton Browning: twelfth grade English, got me to view language as an art
- Peder Melhuse: my acting teacher and mentor in college at the University of Alabama
- Tiza Garland: introduced me to stage movement -- stage combat in particular
- Edmond Williams: cast me in my first Shakespeare play, in which I met the woman whom I would marry
- Seth Panitch: got me to focus on the detail in my work
- Tina Fitch: helped me see through my final year at Alabama under a lot of pressure
- Gary Logan: taught the importance of truly knowing ***every single*** word I speak onstage
- Ellen O'Brien: revealed to me the power of my own voice
- Chris Cherry: taught me the value of rest, and pretty much changed my life through Alexander technique
- Isabelle Anderson: gave me the physical language to find the fire within me
- Dody DiSanto: stripped away all that was in the way of my true (clownish) self
- Brad Waller: gave me the historical perspective of the combat I've been staging for years
- Edward Gero: taught me that a moment "well observed" is the best recognition one could ask for
- Leslie Jacobson: uncovered the depth of both Shakespeare's work, and its effects on me
- Lisae Jordan: the wonder that devoting enough time to one's well-being can do
- Roberta Stiehm: pushed me further in Pilates and dance than I've ever *ever* gone before
- Floyd King: showed me the precision, timing, and attention it takes to tell a well-crafted joke
