Thomas appears as Mr. Darcy opposite Amanda Sox (_Cry It Out_, _In the Next Room_) as Elizabeth Bennett in Kate Hamill's new adaptation of _Pride and Prejudice_ at The Warehouse Theatre, directed by Jay Briggs (_Clybourne Park_, _Important Hats of the Twentieth Century_).

> Thomas Azar’s Darcy is delightfully and comically rigid, stiff-necked, properly postured, and expertly unbending. This makes it only more hilarious in moments when he stoically grimaces through the pain after having hot rum punch on his groin, or moments when he must diffuse overt sexual advances of a drunken partygoer. Azar also perfectly builds Darcy’s inner conflict.

> The cast is uniformly terrific. [Thomas Azar](https://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Thomas-Azar/) and Amanda Sox come the closest to playing things straight, to actually creating realistic(ish) characters. And that's a tribute to them both. Azar and Sox have both demonstrated their dramatic and comedic chops many times on upstate stages, and with a play like this that can border on cartoonish at times, the fact that they can still conjure some human moments amidst the chaos is a wonder indeed.
