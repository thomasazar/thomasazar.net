Moving to New\nYork and presenting himself as an Englishman, he charms his way into a wealthy\nfamily’s life and romances two family members as the seductive and sexually\nprecocious Harry, with more on his mind than love. With his spellbinding and\nemotionally nuanced storytelling, playwright David Cale has created a riveting\nstory of a man leading an outrageous double life."
