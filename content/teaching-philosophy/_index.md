Whether I’m working on a \nshow, at a social gathering, at the store or in a classroom, I can’t \nhelp but tell stories and enjoy the telling of stories. This intrinsic \nconnection to the DNA of theatre is the basis of my teaching as well. In\n connecting with the next generation of artists and students, I am \ncontinuing to write my story, but also creating something new, only \npossible with both the instructor and the student. The students’ \nstories, struggles and journies change my perspective and engage my \npassion for my craft. This exchange is a two-way street as well. My goal\n is always to reciprocate even a fraction of the joy and insight I gain \nback to the students by sharing my own story. It’s the way this exchange\n resembles the collaborative process of theatre-making that draws me to \nteaching."

In some \ncases, such as in the teaching of a design course, the connection is \nstraightforward. However, even when I’m exploring the history of theatre\n with students, I want to connect those historical traditions with the \nliving tradition of contemporary theatre. Understanding our place in the\n greater flow of history helps craft a discerning and self-aware new \naudience out of students to help the theatre survive and thrive in a \ncultural climate made of change and forward momentum. This urgency to \nsurvive and thrive also propels my own work forward, as I work to remain\n relevant in the same culture of forward momentum I prepare my students \nto face."

          "text": "I believe that a hands-on approach breeds students better\n prepared to engage with material on a critical level, as opposed to the\n simple retention of information. In a world where the objective quality\n of a thing is often reduced to a score or percentage, we can often lose\n track of the deeper questions that fuel our individual stories or paths\n through life. The most important pillar of my teaching is that I am \nmore often interested in why a student came to a conclusion or made an \nobservation rather than always seeking the objectively correct answers \nin a given situation. Especially in design, whether I enjoy or like a \nchoice is rarely, if ever, the point. I insist that my students make \nbold choices and that they justify those bold choices, which allows them\n to grow into well-rounded and engaging artists and collaborators. It \nwas exactly this approach that allowed my own art to grow and improve \nover the years, and I’m rarely happier than when I’m watching a student \nexplore the limits of their creativity, whether that exploration is in a\n design project or a play review."

In theatre, a chance to \ncross-train gives us a greater understanding of how the pieces of the \npuzzle come together, but it also opens doors to other possible paths \none can take on life’s journey. My own story is comprised of many such \ndetours and turns made possible by the wide focus of the liberal arts \neducation. In my teaching I work to ensure that this philosophy of a \nbroad lens is applied to my craft. I want my students to understand the \nbroader context of the world and the subjects they study and I also want\n to equip them with the skills needed to approach a problem from many \nperspectives, using the educational foundation of the liberal arts to \ncreate a repertoire of techniques for facing life’s myriad challenges."

Sometimes \nit’s balancing my desire to create and collaborate in the field with my \ndesire to educate and inspire in the classroom. (it turns out these \nconcepts are not mutually exclusive!) Sometimes it’s the need to reach a\n wide range of students from all walks of life. The beauty of theatre is\n deeply rooted in its connection to the entire globe, that the history \nof story-telling is the history of humanity. Capturing that continuity \nand inclusive spirit is the most rewarding challenge I face as a \nteacher. Often these difficulties collide in exciting ways, when I’m \nable to take on a project that speaks to a unique or under-represented \nvoice in our global community. When given that opportunity, I’m able to \nbring the work into the classroom to provide a new perspective on both \nthe story-telling medium and of our shared history and culture. It’s \nthis connection between my professional and pedagogical work that \nignites my spirit more than anything else I do."

I hope to create students who will act as stewards\n of the under-represented in their communities, as theatre is nothing if\n not a conduit for those perspectives in a given community. I also aim \nto create an inclusive community in each of my classrooms, where we can \nlearn these techniques by living them. As a teacher, all of my hope and \npassion rests in teaching by living. And by living, I’m continuing to \ntell my story."
