## John Proctor Is the Villain

Thomas recently appeared as Mr. Smith in the 2019 Kilroy List play _John Proctor Is the Villain_ by Kimberly Belflower, directed by Clemson University Performing Arts chair Becky Becker.

> In present-day Appalachian Georgia, an English assignment becomes uncomfortably relevant when scandal swirls and old heroes are questioned. What does it mean to inherit centuries of trauma and come of age in a world that has always prioritized a man’s reputation above a woman’s experience? The line between witch and heroine blurs in this post-#MeToo examination of power, literature, and sex education. Plus there’s Lorde.

## Recently

Thomas appeared as Mr. Darcy in Kate Hamill's new adaptation of _Pride and Prejudice_ at The Warehouse Theatre, directed by Jay Briggs (_Clybourne Park_, _Important Hats of the Twentieth Century_).

> Thomas Azar’s Darcy is delightfully and comically rigid, stiff-necked, properly postured, and expertly unbending. This makes it only more hilarious in moments when he stoically grimaces through the pain after having hot rum punch on his groin, or moments when he must diffuse overt sexual advances of a drunken partygoer. Azar also perfectly builds Darcy’s inner conflict.

> The cast is uniformly terrific. [Thomas Azar](https://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Thomas-Azar/) [has] demonstrated dramatic and comedic chops many times on upstate stages, and with a play like this that can border on cartoonish at times, the fact that [he] can still conjure some human moments amidst the chaos is a wonder indeed.

Thomas made his debut at [Lean Ensemble Theater](http://www.leanensemble.org/) in Hilton Head, South Carolina, as Paul in _Barefoot in the Park_, directed by artistic director Blake White.
